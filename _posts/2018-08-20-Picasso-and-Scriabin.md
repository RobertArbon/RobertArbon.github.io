On Tuesday 14th August, my friend and composer, <a href="http://georgehollowaycomposer.com/">George Holloway</a>  and I went to see the the Picasso exhibition <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/ey-exhibition-picasso-1932-love-fame-tragedy">1932 - Love, Fame & Tragedy</a> exhibition at the Tate Modern.  This exhibit looked at, month-by-month, the works Picasso finished (or signed off on) in the year 1932. A few thoughts come to mind.

The curation of paintings month-by-month allowed you to become closer to the artist. Very often there were recurring themes or near copies of each other hanging side by side.  This led you to get a sense of what the artist was thinking and feeling on a day-to-day basis.  Each idea was presented a process rather than as a finished product.  Much like seeing maquettes of a sculpture along with the final pieces.

The volume and quality of paintings was staggering.  His work was of such uniformly great quality in that year that it really made you redefine the word <em>productive</em>.  Many of his paintings were done without preliminary sketches. The brush work in others was simple and you got the impression that he just walked up to a blank canvas, applied paint in single strokes and walked away an hour later having finished something incredible.

His affair with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_Walter">Marie-Thérèse Walter</a> (which started when she was 17 and he 45) was presented  as a matter of fact without explicit moral judgement.  On the one hand it seems correct for a curator to just focus on the art of the artists rather than making an explicit criticism of him as a person.  On the other hand, by failing to make an explicit condemnation of his actions are we just tacitly approving, or at least normalizing them?  I think the latter as one could easily have included in the notes, or through some other means, the thoughts and feelings of his cheated wife, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Khokhlova">Olga</a>,  and children.

Later that evening we went to see Daniel Barenboim's East-West Divan orchestra play Tchaikovsky, Coleman and Scriabin.  The Coleman piece, <em>Looking for Palestine</em> for orchestra and soprano was well orchestrated but the vocal line was hard to make out and persisted in what felt like a very narrow pitch range and the words very hard to make out.  This was a real shame as the parts I could make out sounded really interesting.  The <em>Poem of Ecstasy </em>by Scriabin was incredible. The orchestration and the tonal landscape reminded me in parts of Wagner.
