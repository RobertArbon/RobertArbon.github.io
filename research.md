## Overview

My research interests falls in four main areas: metaresearch, model building, sonification and consultancy work. I'm currently finishing my PhD in computational chemistry with [David Glowacki](https://group-wacky.com/)  investigating enzyme dynamics with Markov state models. 

### Metaresearch
I'm working on an crowd-sourced data analysis experiement called [maps](https://osf.io/9qke2/) with [Marcus Munafo](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/expsych/people/marcus-r-munafo/), Natalie Thurlby & Katie Drax. We are hoping to map the possible analytic paths and see where the crowd of analysts lie on that terrain.  Does domain expertise influence the paths taken?  What about prior beliefs?  How good are the models created to explain the phenomena?  This project will be launching mid-January 2019. 

### Model building
How do we know which model is 'the best'?  If our models are only approximate can we still use them? I'm trying to answer these questions in my PhD in the context of models of enzyme dynamics with Markov state and hidden Markov models. 

### Sonification

In collaboration with a sound engineer and fellow Glowacki group member [Alex Jones]() we have been looking at ways of taking the information in hidden Markov models of protein dynamics and displaying it aurally.  In this way you can hear information from the Markov model while viewing the protein itself.  This allows you to associate model features with protein structures. Our first attempt can be found [here](https://osf.io/rzp3k/) and read a short introduction [here]({% post_url 2018-02-19-Sonification-of-biomolecular-dynamics%}).  

### Consultancy work

I'm currently working on a developing a multi-level model to understand AMR transmission in dairy cattle.  This is part of the [OH-STAR](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/vetscience/research/projects/ohstar/) project.
