I was born in 1981 in London, United Kingdom. I attended St Edward’s Comprehensive in Romford, Essex and then Havering Sixth Form College, Upminster, where I studied chemistry, biology, mathematics and music and general studies, achieving two A’s and three B’s at A-Level.

After leaving sixth form college, I went to work for DSTL (at the time DERA) at Porton Down, Salisbury for a year gaining experience in an organic chemistry laboratory.

I was accepted to read chemistry at Worcester College, University of Oxford in an undergraduate masters program (MChem) where I gained a first class degree, was a choral exhibitioner and won the Turbutt Prize for practical organic chemistry. In my final year I performed research with Prof. David Manolopolous in computational chemistry.

After that I attended Harvard University and joined a graduate program in Applied Physics but withdrew after 17 months with a masters degree.  After becoming interested in renewable energy I entered the energy consulting industry where I worked for four years before deciding I wanted to get back into science and maths and became a tutor.

After four years of tutoring I decided to pursue a PhD and I joined the Glowacki group where I work  on modelling enzymatic reactions.
